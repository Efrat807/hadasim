Chanukah light
Walking in the red yellow darkness, sorrow all around
Looking AntiqueWhite Yellow white for some joy, for a hopeful sound
Just when I start to give up, seems there's nothing there
A little glow appears, shining from nowhere

Chorus:
Chanukah light burns so bright
Lifts my soul raises my sights
Chanukah light feels so right
Eight small flames shining through the night

The darkness starts to lift now, help is on its way
Hopelessness is starting to fade away
I lift my eyes to heaven where my help is from
The light, now, from the flames shines for everyone

Chorus

Bridge:
The light is piercing through the darkness
Shining 'til forever
There's hope and love and brotherhood
That's bringing us together
Open up your heart, make a brand new start
Chanukah's the time to take part
Chorus
